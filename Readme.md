Image processing for glare-point shadowgraphy experiments (code) \
by Maximilian Dreisbach (Institute of Fluid Mechanics (ISTM) - Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT))

This code repository contains scripts for the processing of images obtained by the glare-point shadowgraphy technique as presented in the research article "Three-dimensional encoding of a gasâ€“liquid interface by means of color-coded glare points" (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00348-023-03592-0). \
Example datasets from droplet impingement experiments are available here: https://doi.org/10.35097/AcElpeTrdkOvxYWf

## In-situ color correction: P1_Extract_ISC_correction_matrix.m
This script constructs a transfer matrix for in-situ RGB correction using images captured under red, green, and blue illuminations. It calculates a correction matrix and applies it to a test image for spectral reconstruction. Corrected and original images are visualized and saved.

## Image preprocessing for volumetric reconstruction: P2_Preprocess_RGB_for_vol_rec_M3_tilt_dil.m
This script pre-processes glare-point shadowgraphy images for volumetric reconstruction. It applies spectral correction, crops and rotates images, and generates binary masks. The output includes preprocessed RGB images and binary mask files.

## Evaluation of droplet impingement experiments: P3_Determine_contact_angles_M7.m
This script processes high-speed images of a droplet impinging on a solid surface. It calculates dynamic contact angles, impact velocity, and other relevant parameters to characterize the droplet dynamics.\
The key steps include:
  1. Ground detection and frame of impact determination.
  2. Ellipse fitting to the droplet contour for size and position estimation.
  3. Computation of dimensionless numbers (Weber, Reynolds, Ohnesorge, and Bond numbers).
  4. Contact angle and contact line position evaluation over time
  5. Plotting of the results.

## Spectral correction and video creation: P4_Channel_Split_and_Spectral_Correction_batch_M4_videos.m
This script performs spectral correction on glare-point shadowgraphy images and generates videos for different views (bottom, side, glare points only).
